# CointainerSSH

> [ContainerSSH](https://containerssh.io/) launches a new container for each SSH connection in Kubernetes, Podman or Docker.
> The user is transparently dropped in the container and the container is removed when the user disconnects.
> Authentication and container configuration are dynamic using webhooks, no system users required.

# Getting Started
